### Python tools & libraries for managing Hytale game servers

**hy-py** aims to be a collection of Python utilities designed to help server owners, modders, and the community host and manage **Hytale** game servers.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Hytale is not released yet. hy-py is currently in exploratory and tooling development. The first goal is to build the foundation for server automation.

The first component of the project is a command-line interface (CLI) that will eventually provide:

- ✔️ Check server status  
- ✔️ Start / stop / restart a Hytale dedicated server  
- ✔️ Automated backups  
- ✔️ Log management  
- ✔️ Cloud-provider helpers (DigitalOcean, etc.)  
- ✔️ Optional web dashboard components
